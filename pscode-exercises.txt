// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

numsum = num1 + num2



// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if (num % 2 == 1)
	print(number is odd)
else
	print(number is even)



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    


a) Read in 5 separate numbers.

numArray[]
for i in range(5)
	numArray[i] = input("enter a number")
   


b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.

for i in range(5)
	total += numArray[i]

avg = total / len(numArray)



c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.

minVal = numArray[0]
maxVal = numArray[0]
for i in range(5)
	if numArray[i] > maxVal
		maxVal = numArray[i]
	elif numArray[i] < minVal
		minVal = numArray[i]



d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

print("The average is: " + avg)
print("The min value is: " + minVal)
Print("The max value is: " + maxVal)
